# Roarter

A minimalist, intuitive, and unobtrusive middleware framework for Deno.

The goal of Roarter is to only add what is absolutely necessary to the native
HTTP server API, with as few abstractions as we can get away with.

# Handlers

The Application class is responsible for coordinating an HTTP request's
interaction with handlers. You may register a new Handler via
`Application.handle()` as shown below.

```typescript
let app = new Application();

app
  .handle(async (req) => {
    return Response.text("Hello World");
  });

await app.serve({ port: 8080 });
```

If you run the script

```shell
deno run --allow-net helloWorld.ts
```

all requests made to `localhost:8080` will return `Hello World`. This is because
we have not specified any Matchers (see below) for our Handler, so it will match
all/any incoming requests. A Handler without a Matcher is treated as a
`Middleware`.

> NOTE: Handlers must be async (return a promise).
>
> This is to allow Roarter to orchestrate the HTTP request among middlewares and
> handlers.

# Routes

By adding Matchers to Handlers we create `Routes`. Matchers make it so a Handler
is only executed if the given conditions are met.

For instance, if we want our above example to only respond `Hello World` if the
request has an HTTP verb of `GET`, we would do the following:

```typescript
let app = new Application();

app
  .match((req) => req.method === "GET")
  .handle(async (req) => {
    return Response.text("Hello World");
  });

await app.serve({ port: 8080 });
```

Matchers are passed the `Request` object and are expected to return boolean. If
all matchers return `true`, then Roarter will run the `Handler`.

In practice, Roarter includes a lot of the Matchers you would need, so the above
example may be written with the `.get` matcher that's already included in the
framework.

```typescript
app
  .get
  .handle(async (req) => {
    return Response.text("Hello World");
  });
```

> Matchers may also pass information down to their handler which may be accessed
> via `req.params` or `req.vars`.
>
> This is useful when creating matchers that must "capture" values and pass them
> down. An example of this is the `.path("/user/:userId")` matcher which has to
> capture the value passed into `:userId`.
>
> Look at the implementation of the included matchers if you have to build your
> own.

# Params

The `path()` matcher can be used to match a pathname and, optionally, capture
params. It stores all path params under the `req.params`
[Map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map).

```typescript
app
  .get
  .path("/user/:userId")
  .handle(async (req) => {
    return new Response("Echoing param " + req.params.get("userId"));
  });
```

# Middleware

A Handler with no Matchers is treated as a Middleware. Roarter will run all
matching Handlers in order of insertion. Unlike Routes, if a Middleware returns
a Response it will be sent to the client immediately and execution will end.

As an example, let's write two Middlewares. One for parsing `req.body` as a JSON
and another for logging the request.

```typescript
let app = new Application();

const jsonParser = async (req: Request) => {
  if (req.body) {
    req.vars.set("body", await req.json());
  }
};

const logger = async (req: Request) => {
  console.log(`Request sent to ${req.pathname}`);
};

// This Middleware is the first to get executed. It parses req.body and stores it in req.vars for later use.
// Since we want to continue execution, we do not return a Response.
app
  .handle(jsonParser);

// This Route runs second, and it simply returns the variable that was set by our middleware.
// When Routes return a Response, it will only end execution for other Routes, not for the remaining Middleware.
app
  .post
  .path("/json")
  .handle(async (req) => {
    return Response.json(req.vars.get("body"));
  });

// This middleware executes last. It simply logs the request.
// A more common use case would be to perform any cleanup steps made at an earlier point.
app
  .handle(logger);

await app.serve({ port: 8080 });
```

# Routes vs. Middleware

Roarter treats Routes and Middleware a bit differently.

When a Middleware returns a Response, it stops all further execution. On the
other hand, when a Route returns a Response, it only stops all other Routes from
executing, **the remaining Middleware will still run**.

This allows middleware to perform as you would expect from other middleware
frameworks, without requiring the use of `next()`. It allows us to keep the API
a bit simpler and hopefully a bit more intuitive as well.

# Sub Applications

As your application gets larger you will want to logically organize your Routes.
Roarter supports sub-routing to meet this need. Simply pass an instance of
`Application` to the `.handle()` method and it will treat it as a sub-router.

```typescript
let user = new Application();

/**
 * GET tenant/:tenantId/user/:userId
 */
user
  .get
  .path("/user/:userId")
  .handle(async (req) => {
    return new Response(
      `Echoing params ${req.params.get("tenantId")}, ${
        req.params.get("userId")
      }`,
    );
  });

let tenant = new Application();

/**
 * GET tenant/:tenantId
 */
tenant
  .path("/tenant/:tenantId")
  .handle(user);

await tenant.serve({ port: 8080 });
```

# Errors

Roarter `Applications` can handle errors within the Route itself:

```typescript
app
  .post
  .path("/json")
  .handle(async (req) => {
    if (!req.body) {
      return Response.text("no body", { status: 400 });
    }
  });
```

Or via `Application.catch()`:

```typescript
app.catch(async (req, err) => {
  return Response.text(err.message, { status: 500 });
});
```

> `.catch()` gets called if any handlers throw an exception. It is always a good
> idea to add one in production.

# The Request and Response Objects

Roarter's `Request` and `Response` objects extend the native
[Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) and
[Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) objects.
Our goal is for our users to familiarize themselves with the native api as much
as possible. That said, we are not against adding practical utility methods when
needed. Below is a practical example of receiving and responding JSON.

```typescript
let app = new Application();

/**
 * GET /json
 */
app
  .get
  .path("/json")
  .handle(async (req) => {
    const response = {
      id: "123",
      data: [1, 2, 3],
    };

    return Response.json(response);
  });

/**
 * POST /json
 */
app
  .post
  .path("/json")
  .handle(async (req) => {
    if (!req.body) {
      return Response.text("no body", { status: 400 });
    }

    const body = await req.json();

    return Response.json(body);
  });

app.catch(async (req, err) => {
  return Response.text(err.message, { status: 500 });
});

await app.serve({ port: 8080 });
```
